                              Signal Flow Graphs lab

Given:
    Signal flow graph representation of the system. Assume that total number of nodes and numeric branches gains are given.
Required:
    1- Graphical interface.
    2- Draw the signal flow graph showing nodes, branches, gains, …
    3- Listing all forward paths, individual loops, all combination of n non-touching loops.
    4- The values of  , 1 , …, m where m is number of forward paths.
    5- Overall system transfer function.
Notes:
    a- Your executables and source code
    b- Report should include: 
